# Notes about EPR:
-------------------

EPR (Effectively propositional calculus) or sometimes known as Bernays-Schonfinkel class
is a class of first order logic in which all of its formulas follow the following format:
(exits)* (all)* F, where F is the formula.
Moreover, F has no proper functions symbols (all functions present are nullary ones "constants").

These will make our transformations (procedures) get simplified.
Specifically, in range restricting transformations and blocking since they have some steps related
to functions in the domain, and in the case of the EPR no function symbols will be found.

E is a theorem prover for full equational first order logic.
It is a saturation based theorem prover.
