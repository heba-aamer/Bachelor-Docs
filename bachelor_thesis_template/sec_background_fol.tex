\section{Background on first order logic topics} \label{sec:c2s1}

\ac{fol} is an expressive logic that allow us to formulate most of our language sentences.\\*

\ac{epr} or sometimes known as Bernays-Sch√∂nfinkel class
is a class of first order logic in which all of its formulas follow the following format:
