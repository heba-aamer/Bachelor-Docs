\chapter{Methodology and Implementation}\label{chap:meth_and_impl}

	\paragraph{ } Here in this chapter we will discuss the methods applied to extract an explicit model from an \ac{epr} problem specification. And how they are implemented using E's data structures and configurations.

	\paragraph{    In order to achieve our goal,} we had to transform the problems' clauses, which are the axioms of the specification and the negated conjectures(if found), to clauses in range restricted form through a simplified form of range restricted transformations. The original range restricted transformations and there simplified version will be discussed in section \ref{sec:c3s1}.
