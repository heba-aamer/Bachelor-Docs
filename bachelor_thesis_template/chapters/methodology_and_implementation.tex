\chapter{Methodology and Implementation}\label{chap:meth_and_impl}

	\paragraph{} 
	Here in this chapter we will discuss the methods applied to extract an explicit model from an \ac{epr} problem specification. For how they are implemented using E's data structures and configurations, and how to run the program, please refer to chapter \ref{chap:appendix_imp} in the appendix.

	\paragraph{} 
	\textbf{In order to achieve our goal,} we had to transform the problems' clauses, which are the axioms of the specification and the negated conjectures (if found), to clauses in range restricted form through a simplified form of range restricted transformations. The original range restricted transformations and there simplified version will be discussed in section \ref{sec:c3s1}.
