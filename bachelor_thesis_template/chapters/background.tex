\chapter{Background}\label{chap:background}

This chapter is devoted for introducing and familiarizing the reader to the theoretical concepts behind this project, and give the reader a background on the theorem prover E as well. So it will include the following sections:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A background on \ac{fol} in section %TODO add a reference
		\item A background on \ac{epr} in section %TODO add a reference
		\item A background on \ac{atp} in section %TODO add a reference
		\item A background on E in section %TODO add a reference
		\item A background on Problem set in section %TODO add a reference
	\end{itemize}

\section{TPTP Problem set}\label{sec:c2s2}
TPTP problems are first order problems that are considered benchmarks to measure the performance of the theorem provers. TPTP problem set consists of different categories of problems such as : PUZ, NLP, etc....
%TODO add a reference to this ^^^
