\chapter{Testing, Validation and Evaluation}\label{chap:test_and_val}
Here in this chapter, we explain what was done for validating the output and Evaluating the program. So we divide this chapter into two sections:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Validating and Evaluating the Simplified Transformations.
	\item Validating and Evaluating the Implementation of Bachmair and Ganzinger Model Construction Technique.
\end{itemize} 

\section{Simplified Transformations}

\subsection{Evaluating Memory Efficiency}\label{sub:val_tran_mem}
The first part of the implementation which is related to applying the transformations to the the clause set introduces no memory leaks to the whole program.
%TODO add number of problems checked upon


Tools to check this:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Script implemented in E for giving a summary on the allocated and de-allocated memory structures, and the results showed that they are equal.
		\begin{lstlisting}
# -------------------------------------------------
# Total SizeMalloc()ed memory: 68536168 Bytes (131507 requests)
# Total SizeFree()ed   memory: 68536168 Bytes (131507 requests)
# New requests: 214 (197 by SecureMalloc(), 17 by SecureRealloc())
# Total SecureMalloc()ed memory: 277647 Bytes
# Returned: 214 (214 by FREE(), 0 by SecureRealloc())
# SecureRealloc(ptr): 19 (17 Allocs, 0 Frees, 2 Reallocs)
# -------------------------------------------------\\
		\end{lstlisting}
	\item Tool named 'valgrind' which also showed the same results as the above script.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Accuracy of the transformations}
In all tested problems, The results of the Transformations were the same as an implemented program called Yarralumla \url{http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~baumgart/systems/yarralumla/}, implemented by Peter Baumgartner, one of the authors of \cite{BMUG06}. So we believe it is correct.


\section{Bachmair and Ganzinger Model Construction Technique}
\subsection{Evaluating Memory Efficiency}
The same tools mentioned for The Transformations in \ref{sub:val_tran_mem} part were used. And the same results were achieved for the Implemented Model Construction Technique.

\subsection{Accuracy of Implementation}
To Be added later
