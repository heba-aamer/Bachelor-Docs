Testing and Validation


\section{Efficiency}
\subsection{Memory Efficiency}
The first part of the implementation which is related to applying the transformations to the the clause set introduces no memory leaks to the whole program.
%TODO add number of problems checked upon
\\
Tools to check this:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Script implemented in E for giving a summary on the allocated and de-allocated memory structures, and the results showed that they are equal.
\begin{lstlisting}
\\
Ex.:\\
\# -------------------------------------------------
\\
\# Total SizeMalloc()ed memory: 68536168 Bytes (131507 requests)
\\
\# Total SizeFree()ed   memory: 68536168 Bytes (131507 requests)
\\
\# New requests:    214 (   197 by SecureMalloc(),     17 by SecureRealloc())
\\
\# Total SecureMalloc()ed memory: 277647 Bytes
\\
\# Returned:       214 (   214 by FREE(),              0 by SecureRealloc())
\\
\# SecureRealloc(ptr):     19 (    17 Allocs,      0 Frees,      2 Reallocs)
\\
\# -------------------------------------------------
\\
\end{lstlisting}


\item Tool named 'valgrind' which also showed the same results as the above script.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Accuracy of the transformations}
The results of ./edisprover part is the same as the author of the paper implemented program in all the tested problems.
