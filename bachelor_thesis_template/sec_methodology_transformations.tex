\section{Transformations}\label{sec:c3s1}
The methods applied in the project to extract the models follows the transformations discussed in \cite{BMUG06}. A brief on the transformations will be given in \ref{sub:c3s1s1}.
Moreover, as mentioned before that this project is concerned with a sub-class of \ac{fol} which is \ac{epr} some simplifications to the transformations were made. Those simplifications will be discussed in \ref{sub:c3s1s2}.
