\section{Transformations}\label{sec:c3s1}
The methods applied in the project to extract the models follows the transformations discussed in \cite{BMUG06}. A brief on the original transformations will be given in \ref{sub:c3s1s1}.


Moreover, as mentioned before that this project is concerned with a sub-class of \ac{fol} which is \ac{epr} some simplifications to the transformations were made as the removed steps will have no meaning in the context of \ac{epr} problems. Those simplifications will be discussed in \ref{sub:c3s1s2}.
