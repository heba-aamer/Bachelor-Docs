\section{Background on first order logic topics} \label{sec:c2s1}

\ac{fol}, which is also known as first order predicate logic, is an expressive logic that allows us to formulate most of our spoken language sentences in a defined way such that it could be further handled with rules such as simplification, inference rules, etc.\\*
We could represent formulas in \ac{fol} in so many forms. So \ref{sub:c2s1s1} will be devoted to that part of background.\newline
Moreover, in general the universe of \ac{fol} is infinite because of the existence of the quantifiers and function terms. So in \ref{sub:c2s1s2} some topics related to that property will be mentioned including Herbrand Universe.\newline    
Also this project is concerned to a specific class of \ac{fol} its calculus named \ac{epr}, and this will be discussed in \ref{sub:c2s1s4}.
