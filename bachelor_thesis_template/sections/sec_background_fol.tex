\section{\acf{fol}} \label{sec:c2s1}

\ac{fol}, which is also known as first order predicate logic, is an expressive logic that allows us to formulate and encode most of our spoken language sentences in a defined way such that it could be further handled with rules such as simplification, inference rules. That allows automating the reasoning for \ac{fol} problems.


In order to have a general background on the topics of \ac{fol}, we will devote this section to that mission. So we are going to discuss the following points:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Summary over \ac{fol} and Example on using it
		\item Decidability of \ac{fol}
		\item Herbrand Universe
	\end{itemize}

	We could represent formulas in \ac{fol} in so many forms. So \ref{sub:c2s1s1} will be devoted to that part of background.

\subsection{\ac{fol} overview and Example on it}

\subsubsection{Overview on \ac{fol}}
Quantifiers, variables, and functions are what signifies \ac{fol} over propositional logic. Being able to formulate "some", "all" is what added a lot to the expressiveness of \ac{fol}. So a review on the syntax and the structure of \ac{fol} if needed will be found in the appendix here \ref{chap:appendix_fol}.


\subsubsection{Example on \ac{fol}}
A very famous example on \ac{fol} is the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example on \ac{fol},mathescape,breaklines=true,frame=single]

 We want to formulate the following three sentences in $\ac{fol}$:

  (1) All Humans are mortals.
  (2) Socrates is a human.
  (3) Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
  
 So in $\ac{fol}$ syntax they are:

  (1) $\forall X (Human(X) \rightarrow Mortal(X))$
  (2) $Human(socrates)$
  (3) $Mortal(socrates)$
  
 Where $Human$ and $Mortal$ are predicates here since they represent property over the elements of the domain. While $socrates$ is a constant or in other words a function symbol with arity 0. 

\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Decidability of \ac{fol}}
\paragraph{}
The Problem of proving validity, or in other words unsatisfiability, of a formula in \acf{fol} had a lot of attention and experiments in the beginning. A lot of trials were made to prove that it is decidable as mentioned in \cite{SL_14}. But those trials were not successful. Later on, in the same year both \cite{DEC_TUR, DEC_CHURCH} proved that this problem in general is un-decidable.


Some algorithms were developed such that if the formula is unsatisfiable it will give a refutation, or proof in simpler words, however if it was not unsatisfiable then the algorithm may halt/terminate and give the correct result and may not halt/terminate, so this problem is semi-decidable. An example for such procedure is resolution, with some refinements, in which its basic idea was first developed in \cite{RES_65}. So \acf{fol} is semi-decidable logic.
