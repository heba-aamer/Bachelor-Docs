\subsection{Different forms of \ac{fol}}\label{sub:c2s1s1}
\ac{fol} can be represented in different forms. Even some algorithms need to work with specific one.
Moreover, there are some procedures that could transform a formula from one form to another.
Here in this part, we will discuss the most important forms and the relevant ones to the project.
\newline
1- general form\newline 
2- clausal normal form\newline
3- prenex normal form\newline
4- skolem normal form
